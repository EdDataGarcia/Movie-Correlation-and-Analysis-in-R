# Movie Correlation and Analysis in R

# Project Questions

* In the past four decades, were high budgets, huge star power, or a franchise tag necessary to make a top grossing or top profitable movie?

* What other variables helped create a financially successful movie?

* What can be learned from movie trends of the last four decades?

# Source Data and Inspiration

* This project used the ["Movie Industry, Four Decades of Movies"](https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies) data set posted on Kaggle by Daniel Grijalva.

* This project was inspired and informed from Alex Freberg's ["Correlation in Python"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPYVYBtUTyE&ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst) tutorial project on YouTube.

* My mind works better in R than in Python, so I practiced translating Python code and analysis steps into R. 

* I also translated my analysis into a user-friendly dashboard for public consumption. I was inspired and informed from the structure of Abhishek Agarrwal's ["Tableau IMDB Movies Ratings Data Analysis and Dashboard Project Tutorial for Practice"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwO9xK4xUKM&ab_channel=AviSingh-PowerBIPro) project on YouTube.

* My published dashboard is available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ed.garcia/viz/Movies1980-2020/Movies1980-2020#1).
